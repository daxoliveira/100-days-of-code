  </summary>

  **Today's Progress**:
  - Started working on my "Learning JavaScript For Free" Scrimba course.

  **Thoughts:** 

  *"I've decided to start this challenge for the second time around, and this time it's going a little better. I've decided to focus on consistency rather than conding to impressed, which is why I thought a simpler course would be a better option."*

    Day 3: Thursday, September 16th, 2021
  </summary>

  **Today's Progress**:
  - Worked on some HackerRank tests and updating my GitHub Profile.

  **Thoughts:** 

  *"This is the momment I was already expecting, no matter how simple or complicated the challenge is, I tend to get bored with it after a couple of days. I started working on something else such as HackerRank certification tests or updating my GitHub page, and this is where I thought this #100DaysOfCode public commitment would come in handy...it's time to get back to it and finish what I started, see you tomorrow Scrimba."*
